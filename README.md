# COLT-1-2023
CherryIT Collaborative Testing project

### What is COLT?

COLT is a charitable initiative created by Anna Czyrko. The name is an acronym for Collaborative Testing. The main aim of the project is to raise funds for a predefined charitable cause. COLT takes place three times a year and lasts about a month each time. During this time, participants complete daily short tasks based on material published on a dedicated website. This ultimately leads to the creation of a joint project. The theme of each edition is a different testing issue. Throughout the initiative, participants have the opportunity to communicate on a shared Slack channel and work together to solve difficulties they encounter.

### COLT 1/2023

The theme of the first edition of 2023 was Postman and API testing. The subject of testing was the Trello application. Based on its technical documentation, participants defined their scope of work. During the initiative, they also had the opportunity to familiarise themselves with tools such as: 
* Postman - creating collections and requests, environment building, variables
* Git - creating a repository (I chose Github), cloning, creating commits, branching, pull requests
* Trello - creating boards, lists and cards, labelling
* Slack - communication with the team 

Importantly, the money raised in the first edition was donated to the animal shelter 'Psi Raj' in Pasłęk. :cherry_blossom:
